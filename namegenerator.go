		//Ceres /ˈsɪəriːz/[16] (minor-planet designation: 1 Ceres) is the largest object in the main asteroid belt that lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. With a diameter of 940 km (580 mi), Ceres is both the largest of the asteroids and the only unambiguous dwarf planet currently inside Neptune's orbit.[c] It is the 25th-largest body in the Solar System within the orbit of Neptune.[17] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_Ceres
		"ceres",

		//Pallas (minor-planet designation: 2 Pallas) is the second asteroid to have been discovered, after 1 Ceres. It is one of the largest asteroids in the Solar System, and is a likely remnant protoplanet. With an estimated 7% of the mass of the asteroid belt, it is the third-most-massive (and third-largest) asteroid, being three quarters the mass of 4 Vesta and one quarter the mass of Ceres. It is about 510 kilometers (320 mi) in diameter, slightly smaller than Vesta. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2_Pallas
		"pallas",

		//3 Juno is a large asteroid in the asteroid belt. Juno was the third asteroid discovered, in 1804, by German astronomer Karl Harding.[15] It is the 11th-largest asteroid, and one of the two largest stony (S-type) asteroids, along with 15 Eunomia. It is estimated to contain 1% of the total mass of the asteroid belt.[16] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3_Juno
		"juno",

		//Vesta (minor-planet designation: 4 Vesta) is one of the largest objects in the asteroid belt, with a mean diameter of 525 kilometres (326 mi).[9] It was discovered by the German astronomer Heinrich Wilhelm Matthias Olbers on 29 March 1807[7] and is named after Vesta, the virgin goddess of home and hearth from Roman mythology. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_Vesta
		"vesta",

		//Astraea /æˈstriːə/ (minor planet designation: 5 Astraea) is a large asteroid from the asteroid belt. Its surface is highly reflective (bright) and its composition is probably a mixture of nickel–iron with silicates of magnesium and iron. It is an S-type asteroid in the Tholen classification system.[3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Astraea
		"astrea",

		//Hebe /ˈhiːbiː/ (minor planet designation: 6 Hebe) is a large main-belt asteroid, containing around 0.5% of the mass of the belt. However, due to its apparently high bulk density (greater than that of the Moon or even Mars), Hebe does not rank among the top twenty asteroids by volume. This high bulk density suggests an extremely solid body that has not been impacted by collisions, which is not typical of asteroids of its size – they tend to be loosely-bound rubble piles. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6_Hebe
		"hebe",

		//Iris (minor planet designation: 7 Iris) is a large main-belt asteroid orbiting the Sun between Mars and Jupiter. It is the fourth-brightest object in the asteroid belt. It is classified as an S-type asteroid, meaning that it has a stony composition. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_Iris
		"iris",

		//Flora (minor planet designation: 8 Flora) is a large, bright main-belt asteroid. It is the innermost large asteroid: no asteroid closer to the Sun has a diameter above 25 kilometres or two-elevenths that of Flora itself, and not until the tiny 149 Medusa was discovered was a single asteroid orbiting at a closer mean distance known.[7] It is the seventh-brightest asteroid with a mean opposition magnitude of +8.7.[8] Flora can reach a magnitude of +7.9 at a favorable opposition near perihelion, such as occurred in November 2007. Flora may be the residual core of an intensely heated, thermally evolved, and magmatically differentiated planetesimal which was subsequently disrupted.[9] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8_Flora
		"flora",

		//Metis (minor planet designation: 9 Metis) is one of the larger main-belt asteroids. It is composed of silicates and metallic nickel-iron, and may be the core remnant of a large asteroid that was destroyed by an ancient collision.[8] Metis is estimated to contain just under half a percent of the total mass of the asteroid belt.[9] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9_Metis
		"metis",

		//Hygiea (minor planet designation: 10 Hygiea) is a major asteroid located in the main asteroid belt.
